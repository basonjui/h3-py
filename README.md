Sample notebooks & helper transformation functions of h3-py: Uber's H3 Hexagonal Hierarchical Geospatial Indexing System in Python.

As I continue to work on H3 projects, I will keep updating this repository will useful notebooks and transformation helpers.

### Notes 

Due to package availability on Conda, the h3-py package being used in this repository is in version 3.7.6 (the latest H3 version is v.4). 

As of now, v4.0.0 beta has been released for h3-py on pip (https://github.com/uber/h3-py#announcement-v400-beta-released). However, for the purpose of the demo, please install h3-py v.3.7.6 for this repository, as h3-py v.4.0.0 has many breaking changes in the API.
